        <p>Installation programs can be downloaded here <a href="http://ct3.ortolang.fr/trjs/doku.php?id=start">Téléchargement</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Under Windows</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on <a href="http://ct3.ortolang.fr/trjs/doku.php">download link</a>.<br/>
                Select the appropriate Windows version.<br/>
                You can <b>download this file</b>.
            </li>
            <li>In the <b>download</b> directory, and you will find a file named <b>trjs-....exe</b>
                according to the version downloaded.<br/>
                You have to open it to start the installation.<br/>
                On Windows 10, a red window appears that warns against the use of dangerous programs.
                You have to select in the bottom right the message "More information" to obtain
                a screen where you can confirm that you want to use the installation program. <br/>
                The following window appears:
                <img alt="shorcuts" class="align" src="img/capture/dl/02.png"/>
                We suggest to keep selected the <b>Desktop Shortcuts</b>
                so that it will be possible to start TRJS from the Desktop using a shortcut.
                <img alt="location" class="align" src="img/capture/dl/03.png"/>
                The default directory is <b>trjs</b> in "Program Files ..."<br/>
                You can choose any other location.
            <li>The installation of TRJS is <b>finished</b>.
                You can close the installation program.<img alt="endinstall" class="align" src="img/capture/dl/07.png"/>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Under MacOS</h2>
        <p>The download is a zipped file. If you click on this file, it will be
            automatically unzipped. The result is an app file (TRJS.app), that you can move
            into any other location, including the Applications folder.<br/>
            <em>For the first use of the software, use <b>control+right click</b> to start the program,
                instead of right click. This will allow you to confirm that the software is secure
                and can be used on your computer.</em></p>
        <h2>Other systems</h2>
        <p>
            For Linux systems, it is necessary to install starting from the sources.
            Installation from the sources requires the previous installation of Node.js, NPM, Java, FFMPEG and FFPASTE.
            <br/>
            Node.js and NPM are necessary to get the sources and compile the program.
            The other libraries are necessary for file import/export and for wave visualisation and media conversion.
            Some system libraries have to be added, if not present already:
            sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxtst-dev libxkbfile-dev
            <br/>All this can be done with the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre>
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre # if java is not installed (version 8 minimum)
        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
        sudo apt-get install nodejs # the default version of nodejs is not sufficient
        sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxtst-dev libxkbfile-dev
        sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
        </pre>
        <p>
            Sources are available here: http://www.github.com/christopheparisse/trjs/ or
            download the file called "trjs-version-NUMBER.zip". (NUMBER is the version name, for example, 0.7.4).
            Or use git clone.
        </p>
        <pre>
         git clone http://www.github.com/christopheparisse/trjs.git
        </pre>
        <p>Once the downloaded files are unzipped or after using git clone with github, please do:</p>
        <pre>
        npm install
        npm run gulp
        npm run electron
        </pre>
        <p>To run the software once install, it is only necessary to use:</p>
        <pre>
        npm run electron
        </pre>
        <p>
            Starting the command sh buildlinux.sh
            will create a folder named release which contains a folder nammed Trjs-linux-x64<br/>.
            This folder can be move and renammed. It contains the executable file and all parameters.
            It is only necessary to start the "Trjs" file in this folder to start TRJS.
            If Trjs-linux-x64 is moved, the source folder can be removed.
            Or it can be kept for updating the software. To do this, change git clone
            for git pull origin and repeat the whole process.

        <h2>Start TRJS</h2>
        <p>Please double-click on the icon of the program.</p>
        <p>It is possible to associate a file extension to the software so
            it can be started from the finder with specific file types.
            Possible files types are .trjs, .xml, and any file type that can be automatically
            converted by TRJS (chat files, text files, elan files, praat files, transcriber files, subtitle files).
            The use of .trjs is suggested so that it does not create confusion with other file types.
        </p>

        <h2>Layout of the TRJS window</h2>
        <p>Once TRJS is started, it opens the main window.<br/>

        <h2>Structure of the transcription</h2>
            <p>The transcription is presented in a vertical succession of horizontal blocs as in a text.
                Each horizontal bloc corresponds to the description of speech and actions by one speaker.
                Each bloc is made of four parts:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The name of the speakers (this can be presented either by their code or role, or by the name)</li>
                <li>The starting time of the bloc (optional: can be empty)</li>
                <li>The ending time of the bloc (optional: can be empty)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A clic with the mouse on the time makes it possible to edit them in seconds and milliseconds.</li>
                        <li>The number of digits on the left side of the number can be set from 0 to 3 in the parameter section</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>The transcription content</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The blocs can correspond to main lines. These are the topmost lines in the organisation
                of a transcription. Most often, these lines contains the orthographic transcription of
                what was say. This is not always true and possible, for example when coding a language without written
                form such as an signed language or a language of oral tradition. For these cases, any type of information
                can be used such as API or any type of Unicode font.
                <br/>The vertical navigation bar is located at the right of the transcription.
            </p>
            <br/><img class="center winwidth" src="img/capture/i6.png" alt="transcription"/><br/>
            <ul>
                <li>The shades of grey on the lines corresponds to speakers.
                    The are three levels of grey. The dark grey is for the most frequent speaker.
                    The middle grey is for the second most frequent speaker.
                    The light grey s for the other speakers.
                </li>
                <li>The selected line is in yellow and underlined in blue when in edition mode. Dependant lines are in light yellow.</li>
            </ul>
        <p id="nb">
            Putting the cursor on a line will select the corresponding part in the music score.
            Conversly, selecting the music score will select the corresponding line.<br/>
            Selecting a line or the music score will select the corresponding wave position.
            However, selecting the wave position does not changed the position of the music score or the transcription.

        <p>Put the cursor on a locutor line. If this line does not containt any starting time mark,
            use the media to choose the desired starting time and then hit F4, this will set the starting time.You can
            also edit directly the starting time in the first column after the speaker name.<br/>
            <u>From this time on, the TAB kay will start or stop the sound or the video</u>. The keys ALT+left arrow and
            ALT+right arrow make it possible to move forward or backward the media. <u>The transcription can be written
            in real time</u>, at the same time the media is played or not. When a transcription line is finished, hit
            the RETURN key when the media will play the end of the line (or after stoping the media at that exact time). The
            end time will be marked on the second time column, the cursor will go to the next line and the start time of the next
            line will be marked with the same time as the end of the previous line. The process can then be repeated
            as long as necessary.<br/><br/> If the cursor is a the end of the file, new lines will be added to the file.
            If not, the existing lines will be modified and rewritted. <em>This make it possible to adjust an incorrect
            temporal alignement or to align lines without time marker (for example imported lines).</em>
        </p>
        <h2 id="othertranscription">Other transcription mode</h2>
        <p>In some cases, for example if there are some overlaps between speakers, or some silences between a turn and 
            the next ones, or if you want to adjust finely the time setting, there are other linking modes.<br/>
            To insert new lines in the middle of the transcription hit F6 as much as necessary to insert blank lines
            in advance. Or you can hit CTRL+M instead of the RETURN key. This will perform the same operation as the
            RETURN key but with inserting a new line.<br/>
            To set the beginning, it is possible to set the desired time using the media or the wave, and using F4 will set the choosen time at 
            the beginning of the current line.<br/>
            F5 can do the same for the end time. To set the end time, it is possible to set the desired time using the media
            or the wave, and using F5 will set the choosen time at
            the end of the current line.<br/>
            A selection on the wave file can be used to set the start and end time at once: makes a selection on the wave
            and do shift+left click on the selection. This will set the start
            and end time to the current line.<br/>

            <p>The data can be edited in a dedicated part of the window that appears on the top of the window. 
                It is called <em>document structure</em> and contains two parts.</p>
            <h3>Main tiers</h3>
            <p>The main lines contains the most basic and the top level information in a transcription.
                Often they consist of the orthographic transcription and 
                they correspond to what speaker says. However, they are not necessarily speakers, and they
                can take any type of value. 
             </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Code</em>: This makes it possible to specific the <b>code</b> for the speakers. 
                The codes are used to specify the speaker nature in all transcriptions. So the same code is 
                used across various transcriptions so that multiple files can be easily queried.
                Also the code provides information about the role of the speaker.
                For example, for speakers who are children under study the code can be CHI. For speakers that are adult parents, it
                can be MOT (for mother) or FAT (for father) or ADU (for adults). For observers, it can be OBS.
                For general speaker, it can be SPK (this is the default value).
                </li>
                <li><em>Speaker's name</em>: Each code in a transcription can correspond to a unique speaker.
                Speakers information are handled <a href="#h2personal">below</a>. The speaker's name allows to make the correspondance between

            <ul>
                <li><em>Tier</em>: This is the name of the <b>code</b> for this type of tiers.</li>
                <li><em>Type</em>: This describes the temporal or structural relation between the secondary line and its parent line.
                    Relation can be: <em>symbolic association</em>, <em>time subdivision</em>, <em>symbolic subdivision</em>, <em>symbolic subdivision</em>, <em>point</em></li>
                <li><em>Parent</em>: This is the code name of the parent line.</li>

        <h2>Help on keyboard and editing the keyboard shortcuts</h2>
        <p>It is possible to get help about the keyboard association. 
        It is also possible to edit and change them including to associate macro functions.
        This makes it possible to add new characters to the keyboard.<br/>
        The keyboard functions are accessed with the menu <em>Help</em> and <em>Key Bindings</em>.
        This displays four tabs with differents functions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Table of keys</li>
            <li>Table of API keys</li>
            <li>Table of F1/F2 keys</li>
            <li>Changing key bindings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In all tabs it is possible to search for a word or character string so that only a part 
        of the shortcuts are presented. Also, for the first three tabs, it is possible to print 
        the list of shortcuts.</p>
        <p>In the first three tabs on the right, the prefix, the modifiers, the key, the value and the information
         are presented (the prefix, the modifiers, the value, and the information can be empty). It is possible to sort by each field 
         by clicking on the name on top of column.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prefix are optional key functions to be used before using the key itself.
            They do not have to be pressed at the same time as the key itself.</li>
            <li>Modifiers correspond the use or not of the specific keys "Shift", "Ctrl/Cmd", "Alt". 
            On Mac OSX (Apple computers) the use of Ctrl or Cmd is equivalent. It is possible to use whichever
            key. Modifier keys have to be used a fraction of second before the main key and to be kept pressed 
            when pressing the main key.</li>
            <li>Key is the keyboard key.</li>
            <li>Value: certain key asssociation will result in inserting a certain material
            in the transcription. This is especially the case for API and F1/F2 functions.</li>
            <li>Information describes the function of the key.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the last tab on the right, it is possible to change the association between a key and a function.
            All changes must be saved by clicking on "Save the new key associations". Otherwise the changes will be ignored.
            Clicking on "Reset the default keys" will erase the user defined associations and go back to the default association.
            Only default association are presented in this help.<br/>
            All the known functions of TRJS are listed on the left, including the functions which are not associated with a shortcut key.
            To change a key association, it is necessary to click on "Edit".<br/>
            <img class="center winwidth" src="img/capture/keyedit.png" alt="editing the key"/><br/>
            This shows a window where it is possible to change the values for the prefix, the modifiers (CMD, ALT, SHIFT), and
            the key itself. If validated using OK, the associated will be displayed but it is not saved.
            To do this it is necessary to click on the "Save the new key associations" which is now in orange.
            Not saving will cancel all the currently edited associations.
        </p>
        <p>It is possible to associate some characters with a keyboard key. To do this use, the macro function described in here and create new
            macros of type any value. In this way, it is possible to associate keys with any Unicode characters. See
            <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/">https://unicode-table.com/en/</a> or 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters</a>
            for a list of all possible Unicode values (many pages on the web provide allows to copy easily a Unicode character in the clipboard).
            So it is possible to use any possible characters in TRJS. 
            <!--
            For example, you could the Phoenician alphabet as described here
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet#Unicode">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet#Unicode</a> and like Alt+A with 𐤀, Alt+B with 𐤁, etc.
            -->
            For example, you could Miscellaneous Symbols in the wikipedia page and associate Alt+K with a cup of coffee ☕.

		<h1 id="macros">Macros</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>Macros make it possible to insert quickly a string of characters according to the user choice.
            There is no limit to the number of macros that can be used. The macros can be associated
            with a keyboard shorcut so that their use is even faster.
            A subset of macros is predefined to be used with the CHAT format or the CORLI/IRCOM/Spoken language
            format. It is possible to define any type of macro even when choosing to use also the CLAN or IRCOM
            subsets.
		</p>
		<h2>Creating/editing macros</h2>
		<p>Macros can be created and edited so that they contains any type of
            characters. There are tools that make it possible to create semi-predefined
            macros with the desired format.
		<ul>
		    <li>CHAT mode (macros that help creating easily CHAT codes - cf. childes.talkbank.org)</li>
		    <li>XML TEI mode (macros that help to use the CORLI/IRCOM format) and generated automatically
                a file in XML TEI format.
		    </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Creation, edition and insertion of macros are available in the menu
            <em>Tools</em> / <em>Macros</em>. The window that opens allows to edit a new
            macro or find an existing macro and change it.
            It is also possible to associate a keyboard shortcut.
		</p>

		<h3>Creating a macro</h3>
		<p>The following steps have to be done in this strict order:</p>
		<ol>
		    <li>Select "new macro" in the field "Find"</li>
		    <li>Type a name not yet used in the field "Name for the new macro"
                This means a name that is not found in the list "Find". If you use a name already used,
                the new name will erase the old one.
		    </li>
		    <li>Select a type of macro in the field "Type". The choice of redefined macro type values depends
		        of the edition mode (CHAT/TEI/other). All modes have the "Any value" macro type
		        which makes it possible to insert any characters without constraints.
		    </li>
		    <li>The content of each macro is defined by three elements:
		        <ol>
		            <li>The macro type. It contains predefined values. For exemple, for a silence of specific length
		                in CHAT format, it is "(" and ")". The macro type "Any value"
		                does not add any element.
		            </li>
		            <li>The value of the macro: this is the first (optional) argument of the macro. This value is
                        added in the predefined value of the macro (according to the predefined type). For example, for a silence of
                        specific length in the format CHAT, this value could be that of the length of a silence.
                        Associated with "(" and ")", it will create the final value. For the macro type "Any value"
                        this value corresponds exactly to the added element.
		            </li>
		            <li>Some predefined macros contain two potential value locations.
                        The field complement (second argument) allows to fill the second places.
		            </li>
		        </ol>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        <ul>
		            <li>So depending on the type of macro, the type, then the field "Value" and finally optionally the 
                        field "Complement" will be integrated in the macro.
		            </li>
		            <li>The CHAT type makes it easy to insert CHAT codes.</li>
		            <li>
		                <ul>
		                    <li>Any value: insert the content of "Value".</li>
		                    <li>Repetition: insert [/] - no argument.</li>
		                </ul>
		            </li>
		            <li>The TEI XML type makes it easy to insert IRCOM / CORLI codes that will be
                        automatically converted to XML / TEI format. In addition, this editing mode allows you to insert
                        any XML codes. The "Value" field usually encodes the contents of the code for the
                        transcription of spoken language, the "complement" field encodes the field subtype when necessary.
		            </li>
		            <li>
		                <ul>
		                    <li>Any value: insert the content of "Value".</li>
		                    <li>Noise: insert [%1 /%2 /N] - %1 is replaced by Value, %2 is replaced by Complement.</li>
		                    <li>Event: insert [%1 /%2 /E] - %1 is replaced by Value, %2 is replaced by Complement.</li>
		                    <li>Abbreviation: insert {%1 /%2 /A} - %1 is replaced by Value, %2 is replaced by Complement.</li>
		                    <li>Variante: insert {%1 /%2 /VAR} - %1 is replaced by Value, %2 is replaced by Complement.</li>
		                    <li>Language: insert { /%2 /LG:%1} - %1 is replaced by Value, %2 is replaced by Complement.</li>
		                    <li>Comment: insert [%1 /%2 /COM] - %1 is replaced by Value, %2 is replaced by Complement.</li>
		                    <li>Vocal: insert {%1 /VOC} - %1 is replaced by Value.</li>
		                    <li>Short pause: insert # .</li>
		                    <li>Middle pause: insert ## .</li>
		                    <li>Long pause: insert ### .</li>
		                    <li>Very long pause: insert #%1# - Valeur est inséré à la place de %1.</li>
		                    <li>Lexical: insert {%1 /%2 /LEX} - %1 is replaced by Value, %2 is replaced by Complement.</li>
		                    <li>Entities: insert {%1 /%2 /NE} - %1 is replaced by Value, %2 is replaced by Complement.</li>

		<h1 id="format">Format of transcripts</h1>
		<hr/>
		<h2>Formats</h2>
		<p>There are several formats that can be used for the transcription of spoken data.
            TRJS offers several editing modes that result in differences in the format
            of the main transcription lines. These modes affect the nature of the predefined macros
            of the user, the format verification of the main lines, and on how TRJS handles
            the characters &lt; et &gt;.
		</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>CHAT mode (CHAT format - cf. childes.talkbank.org) - special characters &lt; et &gt; are coded as XML entities.</li>
		    <li>XML TEI mode (format for representing IRCOM codes). This mode allows the insertion of characters &lt; and &gt;
                in their original form so as to create XML tags within the transcriptions.
		    </li>
		    <li>Raw mode: no constraints and verfication of the main lines.
                Special characters &lt; and &gt; are encoded as XML entities.
		    </li>
		</ul>
		<p>The format is selected by choosing the "Tools" menu then "Parameters" then the "Verification" tab then finally choose the
            type of transcription (CHAT, XML TEI, None)
		</p>
		<h2>Control of main lines</h2>
		<p>Some format checks of the transcript content can be done live or at the time of saving the files.
            These controls are based on the type of format.
            Checks on alignment marks are always done. Controls on the format of
            transcripts are made according to the chosen transcription format.
		</p>
		<p>The current line is controlled using the ALT + e key. A message indicates the possible error and
            also manifests by the presence of crosses around the speaker's name. If a correction is made, the display will disappear.
            If no correction is made, the crosses will not be
            not saved when saving the file. It is therefore only a visual information.
		</p>
		<h2>Control of temporal links</h2>
		<p>It is illogical to have a temporal alignment that covers another one for the same speaker.
            Therefore, when such cases are encountered, the name of the speaker is indicated by the display of crosses around
            the name of the speaker.
		</p>
		<h2>Control of transcripts</h2>
		<p>An error on the format CHAT or on the use of the characters &lt; and &gt; will bring an error message.
            Also, the name of the speaker is indicated by the display of crosses around
            the name of the speaker.
		</p>
		<h2>Equivalences between IRCOM format and XML TEI format</h2>
		<p>IRCOM format codes are automatically converted to the TEI XML encoding format when
            saving data. Conversely, reading a file in TEI XML format will generate IRCOM codes.
		</p>
		<ul>
		    <li>List of equivalences</li>
